OrkestraLib Test page
=====================

**Basic usage:** Given the complexity of the tool, we have split a basic functionality on different test, in order to develop andÂ  found errors easier. Those are some testing pages available, hope we will add more soon:

**Layout Test**

In order to test a developed layout, it can be used to see is working as we expect.

[http://localhost:8080/test/ui/layout.html](http://localhost:8080/test/ui/layout.html "http://localhost:8080/test/ui/layout.html")

**Components Propagation**

This can be used to evaluate a component distribution rules.

**Motion Test**

Util test to validate a orkestraLib synchronization functionality

**Multimedia sync:**

[http://localhost:8080/test/motion/multimediaSync.html](http://localhost:8080/test/motion/multimediaSync.html "http://localhost:8080/test/motion/multimediaSync.html")

**Object Sync:**

[http://localhost:8080/test/motion/objectSync.html](http://localhost:8080/test/motion/objectSync.html "http://localhost:8080/test/motion/objectSync.html")

**WebRtc Test**

There are some test to evaluate a webrtc implementation of orkestraLib, based on janusGW.

**Publish stream:**

[http://localhost:8080/test/janus/publish.html](http://localhost:8080/test/janus/publish.html "http://localhost:8080/test/janus/publish.html")

**Consume stream:**

[http://localhost:8080/test/janus/client.html](http://localhost:8080/test/janus/client.html "http://localhost:8080/test/janus/client.html")

**XMedia Test**

Test a webcomponents responsible of the orkestraLib multimedia consume.

#### TODO

**User & App Data Test**

TODO: This type of application must have some monitoring tool that allow to know the state of the shared data all the time, in order to control and understand that behind functionality. In this sense, we plan to create a monitoring tool of user & app data of the each session.
